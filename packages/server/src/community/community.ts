  /**
   * Checks whether two communities, identified by their IDs, are not allied.

   * This function queries the database for an entry in the `alliances` table
   * that indicates an alliance between the two specified community IDs. If
   * no such entry exists, the communities are considered "not allied."
   *
   * @param {string} id_1 - The ID of the first community.
   * @param {string} id_2 - The ID of the second community.
   * @returns {boolean} - Returns `true` if the communities are not allied,
   *                      `false` if they are allied.
   *
   * Database query explanation:
   * - The SQL query checks for a record in the `alliances` table where
   *   `community_1_id` matches `id_1` and `community_2_id` matches `id_2`.
   * - If a matching record is found, the two communities are allied.
   * - If no record is found, they are not allied.
